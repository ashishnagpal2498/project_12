6)Flip image - Their Content heel details -
7)About us page
8)Navbar theek
9)Put page 2 in routes its giving path error for previous directory of PUBLIC_static
10)Finalise the working on the type of


Adding a button shopping cart making it through API


Notes:-
Everything is working through API
1) Index . html we are sending that through base url '/'
2) Login button - when we click on that , "  window . location " se vo 1ogin page par chala jata hai
3) when we submit that , toh DBMS mein check hota hau IF the user exist , toh page redirect ho jata hai to main page
4) Varna phir Vo ussi page par rehta h And says : either username or password entered is wrong.....
5) Signup page create : Create its Database which includes two tables : 1 mein sirf username and password rahega
6) Doosre mein we are having personal details of user (NEED TO CREATE THIS ) - Foreign key
7) NOW jab login ho jaye Aur redirect karke aaye toh it should display the " Name " of " User  instead of login page

8) Add to cart button - : Check if the user is logged in Toh empty cart ya kuch dikhayega :
9) If the user is not logged in toh 1 disclaimer dega + Signup button dega jisse vo Signup kar sake ;
10) Signup ke andar check karna hai phele vo user exist toh nhi karta ; Varna phir details eneter kardo DBMS mein

11) Login/signup ka database directly sql se chal rha h
12) Page 2 button par click krte hai tab - window load hoti hai page2 ke location par
13) This page is handled by AJAX request - All the images used are dynamically created , path brought from database
and divs are created = They have their attribute as their id in database
I dont know why post request works here but not get ;

14) When i click on any of the image toh AJX ke through images change hoti hai and id stored
getters and setters are used in the sequelize to store imagepath array ..........

15) Need to create a last page where final preview of the image is show , quantity price ; size add to cart , continue shopping checkout

16) Need to create a cart which is stored on local storage show

17) Login through google / payments method / edit front end

18)All the pages are going through express static , thats why no get request through root works.
